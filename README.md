# Refactoring the source code for Wanderers(dot)io
- this was a game i used to really like playing, made by Przemyslaw 'rezoner' Sikorski, but sadly it got shut down 
- so i have taken on the task of refactoring the source code so its not 30,000 lines long and in one file and so that it makes sense 
- i still have a long way to go but the end goal is being able to improve upon the original game by adding some of my own original ideas and features 
- and also possibly converting it all to python3 or something, i cannot stand JS 
- some files are still empty cause im still in the process of moving everything over to their respective place from the old script file
- additionally, theres no connections to any of the files yet, cause, god im gonna have to figure that out later
- but for now i thought id push this here and come back to it later
